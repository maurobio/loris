# ![LORIS](LORIS.BMP)Loris
A simple program for off-line visualization of HTML and XML documents and embedded images. 

Loris is an HTML and XML file viewer for microcomputers of the IBM-PC line, running under the operating environment Microsoft Windows '95, '98, 2000, NT, ME, XP, Vista, 8, 8.1, 10, 11.

The main purpose of Loris is to be used for off-line visualization of HTML and XML files, without having to purchase or install a WWW pager such as Mosaic, Netscape, or IE. This program can be very useful in the process of creating presentation pages on the Web, when used in conjunction with a specialized HTML editor, allowing you to quickly preview the pages as they are being created.

Loris is able to read HTML files including most of the 2.0 specifications as well as some of the 3.0 extensions. In its current version, the program supports:

- Embedded images (Inline), in BMP, PGIF and JPEG formats

- Transparent GIF images such as "Wallpaper"

- Fonts in different sizes, styles and colors

- Formatted printing of HTML documents

- Search text in HTML documents

- HTML tables

- HTML forms

- Frames 

- Animated GIF images

- XML Documents

On the other hand, Java Scripts and Applets are not supported.

The name of the program was given in allusion to the lorises (Asian prosimians of the lorisid family, with large eyes and nocturnal habits), common on the island of Java.

This program was developed in Object Pascal with Borland International's Delphi compiler, version 7.0 Personal Edition for Windows 32-bits, with support from THTMLViewer/TFrameViewer components, by L. David Baldwin (available at http://www.pbear.com) and XMLParser by Stefan Heymann (available from http://www.destructor.de).
